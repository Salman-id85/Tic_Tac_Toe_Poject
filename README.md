# Tic_Tac_Toe_Poject

# Summary:
In a three-line variant of Tic Tac Toe, the game is streamlined with a smaller grid and simpler winning conditions. Players strive to create a continuous line of their symbols, typically X or O, across the grid. The winning condition is to achieve three of their symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Horizontal lines are formed by placing three symbols side by side along a row, vertical lines require three symbols stacked on top of each other in a column, and diagonal lines span from one corner of the grid to the opposite corner. The game concludes when one player successfully achieves any of these three-line configurations. If the grid fills up before any player achieves this, the game ends in a draw.

# The rules and conditions are straightforward:

Game Board:
          The traditional version of Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid with a total of 9 squares1.
Players choose their mark at the beginning of the game, either “X” or “O”, and continue using the same mark throughout the game1.
Each player takes turns, making only one mark during their turn1.

Winning Conditions:
          A player wins the game if they successfully create a sequence of three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal2.
The game ends immediately when a player achieves this winning sequence.

Draw Condition:
            If all nine squares on the grid are filled, and no player has formed a winning sequence, the game is declared a draw2.
